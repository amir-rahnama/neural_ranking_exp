#  Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations for Neural Ranking Models

* To retrain the model, run ```tf_ranking_canned_gam.py```. 

* To get the result for our proposed explanations, run ```generating_exps.py```.

* To get the result for LIRME, EXS, LIME and SHAP, run ```generating_lirme_exps.py```. The implementaiton of LIRME and EXS is in file ```lirme.py``` and ```utils.py```.

* To run our evaluation for explanations of documents with rank 2, run ```Evaluation V2 (Rank 2).ipynb```. Similar evaluation can be done for documents with predicted rank 10 in ```Evaluation V2.ipynb```.
